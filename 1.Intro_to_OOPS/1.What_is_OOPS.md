# 1. What is a OOP? 

**OOPs** stands for **Object-Oriented Programming System**. 

It is a **programming paradigm** based on the concept of **"objects".**

Objects can hold **data** and **methods** (functions) that operate on that data.

In Java, almost everything is an object, and OOP allows us to structure programs using reusable pieces of code (classes and objects).
